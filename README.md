# CS 340 Portfolio – Project Two

## Portfolio Reflection – CS 340

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I write maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs by using modular design, clear naming conventions, and separation of concerns. In Project One, I created a CRUD Python module that handled all database interactions in one place. This allowed the dashboard code in Project Two to focus only on displaying and interacting with data, rather than managing database logic directly.

The advantage of working this way was that changes to the database logic only needed to be made in one module, rather than throughout the entire application. This made the code easier to debug, update, and reuse. In the future, this CRUD module could be reused for other dashboards, analytics tools, or applications that need to interact with a MongoDB database.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems by first understanding the client’s requirements, then breaking those requirements down into smaller, manageable tasks. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I focused on understanding the database structure, the filtering requirements, and how the dashboard widgets would interact with the data.

This approach differed from earlier courses where assignments were more isolated or theoretical. In this project, I had to think about real-world constraints, client expectations, and how multiple components worked together. In the future, I would continue using this structured approach by gathering requirements first, designing the data model carefully, and validating that the database supports both current and future client needs.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, build, and improve systems that help organizations work more efficiently and make better decisions. This work matters because reliable software reduces errors, saves time, and allows organizations to use data effectively.

This project demonstrates how a data-driven dashboard can support a company like Grazioso Salvare by making animal data easier to filter, analyze, and visualize, enabling the organization to focus more on its mission.
